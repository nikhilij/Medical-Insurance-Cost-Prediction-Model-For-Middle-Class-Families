# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction for Middle-Class Families
This repository presents a machine learning project aimed at predicting medical insurance costs for middle-class families. By analyzing various demographic and health-related features, the model estimates individual insurance charges, providing valuable insights for financial planning and healthcare budgeting.

Project Overview:

Objective: Develop a predictive model to estimate medical insurance costs based on factors such as age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

Dataset: Utilizes a publicly available dataset containing information on individuals' demographics and medical charges.

Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify patterns and correlations between features and target variable.
Model Development: Implement machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests to predict insurance costs.
Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
Key Features:

Predictive Accuracy: Achieved a prediction accuracy of approximately 86% using the Random Forest Regressor model.

Insights: Identified that factors such as smoking status, BMI, and age significantly influence insurance charges, while sex, number of children, and region have minimal impact.
